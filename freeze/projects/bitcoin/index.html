        <h1>The Prediction of Bitcoin Price in Short Future</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Inspired by the idea of the language model in NLP, my previous advisor and I tried to build the model that was able to predict the price of bitcoin in the short future. The reason why short-term future is that the long-term price is affected by a wide variety of factors, for example, the news that may have a good or bad influence on the market. On the other hand, the prediction of the long-term future can be achieved by changing the data granularity in terms of the sample rate, at the expense of losing the accuracy. In other words, for any given granularity, the accuracy of prediction is dominated by the Gaussian distribution with the mean equal to the average price in the distance defined by the granularity. It reminds me of the famous theory of uncertainty developed by Dr. Werner Heisenberg. We cannot accurately measure the change of position of a quantum and its change of momentum at the same time. In our case, we cannot achieve both the accuracy and the length of prediction at the same time. The mathematics behind this is that the position and the momentum are conjugate. There are many pairs of conjugate variables in the real world, for example, time and energy, gravitational potential and mass density, so on and so forth.</p>
        <p>We collected the price data of bitcoin/USD every second for about 3 years. Similar to how people build language models in NLP, we set the window of historical data to be 60 seconds and predict the price at the 61st second. To increase the accuracy, we also take into consideration multi-dimensional data, including volumes, spread, and 10-days SMA. We tried the LSTM model, the KD-tree model, and the Transformer model. The results showed that the transformer model gave us the lowest MSE. Using the transformer model, we can achieve the MSE as low as 5.004, which was SOTA in early 2020.</p>

        <p>However, when we used our prediction to build the strategies in the simulated market, we lost almost all the money. The problem seems to be that our model indeed learned some features based on the values it saw in historical data, but the price itself misled the model. Let me explain it in this way: Imagine you are about to build a language model. You should somehow vectorize the lexical data and feed the vectorized representation of each word into the model, regardless of its architecture. The better method should be that we treat the price that we tried to predict as "lexical data." We use the vectorized version of it, in our case, the volume, spread, and SMA, by the way, we can still build more representations on top of the price data, as training examples. In this way, we are playing the role of numerologists.</p>
